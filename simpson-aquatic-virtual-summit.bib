@ARTICLE{Rigby2005-nl,
  title     = "Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape",
  author    = "Rigby, R A and Stasinopoulos, D M",
  abstract  = "Summary. A general class of statistical models for a univariate
               response variable is presented which we call the generalized
               additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model
               assumes independent observations of the response variable y
               given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values
               of the random effects. The distribution for the response
               variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general
               family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic
               continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of
               the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean
               (or location) but also of the other parameters of the
               distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric
               (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or
               random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation
               is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton--Raphson or
               Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized)
               likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using
               a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated
               into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of
               application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the
               GAMLSS class of models.",
